Guys …
Those who have given 
1) Average rating : Can you help me out with the reason ?So that i can take care of it from next class
2) Good : Help me out with the reason for giving -1 (good) rating. so that i can take care of it from next class?
3) Excellent: thanks a lot :) :) :)
also for those whose orientation is not done …
GOOD is a negative feedback guys...it is -1 
Excellent is +1
Bad /avg is -5 

so lets say if out of 10 people ….. 8 gave excellent and 1 gave bad and 1 good the rating will drop down to (9-5-1)/10 = 3/10 =30%
